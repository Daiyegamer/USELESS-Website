Favicon Generator
 I am Creating a favicon generator website using PHP can be an interesting project. The favicon generator would take an image uploaded by the user and convert it into a favicon file, which is usually a 16x16 or 32x32 pixel .ico or .png file. 
 I am planning to use php to create the website
 and host it on webhostcanada
